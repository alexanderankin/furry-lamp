# Concepts

The end goal is to have a system that generates, in a read only (influce only at
creation) way, independent systems without enforcing or influencing them later
on. To that end, development will first consist of making a single prototype
system that is manually deployable, proposing that the underlying mechanism to
generate new instances later on be done by code generation in a completely
external modular program.
